  - Login to Client-1 with Remote Desktop and ping DC-1’s private IP address with ping -t <ip address> (perpetual ping)
- Login to the Domain Controller and enable ICMPv4 in on the local windows Firewall
- Check back at Client-1 to see the ping succeed

- Login to DC-1 and install Active Directory Domain Services
- Promote as a DC: Setup a new forest as mydomain.com (can be anything, just remember what it is)
- Restart and then log back into DC-1 as user: mydomain.com\labuser

</p>
<p>
- Create an Admin and Normal User Account in AD
- In Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), create an Organizational Unit (OU) called “_EMPLOYEES”
- Create a new OU named “_ADMINS”
- Create a new employee named “Jane Doe” (same password) with the username of “jane_admin”
- Add jane_admin to the “Domain Admins” Security Group
- Log out/close the Remote Desktop connection to DC-1 and log back in as “mydomain.com\jane_admin”
- User jane_admin as your admin account from now on
<br />

</p>
<p>
- Join Client-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)
- From the Azure Portal, set Client-1’s DNS settings to the DC’s Private IP address
- From the Azure Portal, restart Client-1
- Login to Client-1 (Remote Desktop) as the original local admin (labuser) and join it to the domain (computer will restart)
- Login to the Domain Controller (Remote Desktop) and verify Client-1 shows up in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) inside the “Computers” container on the root of the domain
- Create a new OU named “_CLIENTS” and drag Client-1 into there
<br />

</p>
<p>
- Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1
- Log into Client-1 as mydomain.com\jane_admin and open system properties
- Click “Remote Desktop”
- Allow “domain users” access to remote desktop
- You can now log into Client-1 as a normal, non-administrative user now
- Normally you’d want to do this with Group Policy that allows you to change MANY systems at once
