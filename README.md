First we configure roles, departments, and teams. To do that we must first go into the admin panel and from there we have access to all the respective tabs. In roles we will create a "supreme admin" role that has access to do everything osTicket allows roles to do. Then in departments we will create a "system administrators" department. And then finally in teams we will create two teams, one named "level 1 support" and the other named "level 2 support."
